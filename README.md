# User Story

* This is a responsive Portfolio Website, designed and coded by Peter A Cardillo. The site will be using Bootstrap for layout and design. Some custom CSS styles have been added and are located in the respective .html files. I did not include a seperate css style sheet since the majority of the style is managed by Bootstrap and the styles I added - I want to be explicitly seen in the .html file they are being applied.

* The primary purpose of this website is to describe the developers skillsets, show previous work and request contact information for potential work.
