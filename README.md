HW #8: Responsive Portfilio - UPDATED
Due: Saturday, January 12, 2021 @ 11:59pm Local
User Story
This is a responsive Portfolio Website, designed and coded by Peter A Cardillo. The site will be using Bootstrap for layout and design. Some custom CSS styles have been added and are located in the respective .html files. I did not include a seperate css style sheet since the majority of the style is managed by Bootstrap and the styles I added - I want to be explicitly seen in the .html file they are being applied.

The primary purpose of this website is to describe the developers skillsets, show previous work and request contact information for potential work.

This Portfolio Project has been updated with my current completed work during this Fullstack Bootcamp

There are 3 pages in this application addressing this purpose:
About/Home page
Contact page
Portfolio page
Using Bootstrap, design a site adhering to the following Acceptance Criteria
Include a Navigation Bar (consistant throughout the application)
Create a Responsive Layout (utilizing Bootstrap components & grid system)
Responsive Images
Use a HTML validation service to ensure valid HTML
Submit the link to the gitHub repository
Submit the link to the live application
Include a descriptive README file
All links are to be working

The following Acceptance Criteria has been checked following these scenarios:
WHEN I view the souce code and open the application:
THEN I can see the Bootstrap navigation code
THEN when using the application, all links navigate to their logical destination
WHEN resizing the screen size, from large to small:
THEN I can see the images responsivly line up attractivly within the new viewport size
THEN I can see the word wraping around images
THEN I can see images resize to the new size layout/s
WHEN I enter the code for each of the sites pages into a HTML validator such as: (https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea)
THEN I can see that there are no errors or warnings in each of the 3 files, index.html, contact.html protfolio.html
WHEN I check all the hyperlinks and site navigation linking
THEN I can confirm that all links are working
Included below are the gitHub repo & web URL links
The site contains my personalized information, including my name, self portrait, contact information and description of my skillsets and experience.
Semantic tags, inline style CSS has been included when necessary and commeted accordinly throughout the code.
BONUS:
